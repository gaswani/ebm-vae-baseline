# SHAP Explainability Module for EBM–VAE Anomaly Detection
# -------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE:
# This file is intended to be placed under:
#   ebm_anomalies/shap_explainability.py
#
# It implements SHAP explainability using a surrogate LightGBM model
# to explain VAE reconstruction-error–based anomaly scores.
#
# Copy-paste the full implementation from the assistant's prior response
# into this file before use.
